## Notes-Manager  in C


This repository contains a simple command-line note management system implemented in C. The system allows users to register, log in, and manage their notes efficiently. It provides functionality for adding, viewing, editing, and deleting notes within a user's directory.

**Features:**

- **Registration and Login:** Users can register for a new account or log in to an existing account.
- **Note Management:** Users can add, view, edit, and delete notes from their personal directory.
- **Basic Security:** User passwords are stored securely ( not much secure to be honest, it just stores in a text file...will apply encryption functionality later on) and basic error handling is implemented.

**How to Use:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/note-management-system.git
   ```

2. **Compile the Code:**
   ```
   cd note-management-system
   gcc main.c -o notes
   ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   ```
   ./notes
   ```

4. **Follow On-Screen Instructions:** The program will prompt you to register or log in. Once logged in, you can perform note management operations as per the menu options.

**Dependencies:**

- This program is written in C and requires a C compiler (such as GCC) to compile.
- No external libraries are required.

**Contributing:**

Contributions to improve the functionality, usability, and security of the note management system are welcome. If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
